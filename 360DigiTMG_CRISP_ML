Day 2
1. Business Understanding refers to as understanding the business problem  and
the two key things to document as part of that are business objective and business constraints.
2. Data understanding refers to understanding what data we will need in order to solve the business
problem and what type of data it is.

Day 3
1. Continous data can be represented as decimals while discrete can not.
2. We have Continous data which further can be either interval or ratio, and 
discrete data which further is categorical( Binary, Nominal, Ordinal).


Day 4
1. Time series and Cross sectional data differs in the fact that date/time , sequence is
not important in cross sectional data while it matters in Time series data
2. Offline processing usually collects data on a pre set time, it could be once or twice a day 
or once a week. Online processing is almost a continous stream of data being passed for processing.
e.g. credit card fraud detection, if the data is not passed live we would not be able to 
immediately detect the fraud, imagine the data being passed offline, fraud detection will happen
later when the data would be passed and processed.
