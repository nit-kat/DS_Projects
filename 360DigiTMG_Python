Day 1
1. Python is case-sensitive. As for different variables lets say python and PYTHON it reates two different variables 
and does not consider them the same.
2. Rules to create variable name are:
Cannot start with a number.
Must contain only alphabets, digits or underscore.
Can start with underscore.
Cannot contain space.
Best practice is to have lowercase.

Day 2
1. There are words which python uses internally, those are referred to as reserved words.
To name a few, try, catch, if, finally, etc.
2. There are many different operators in python.
Below are some of the commonly used :
Arithmetic (+,-,*,/)
Comparison(>,<,==,!=,<=,>=)
Assignment ( +=, -=, *=, /=)
Logical( and, or, not)

Day 3
1. Operators with examples
10+20=30
10-20=-10
10*20=200
10/20=0.5

10==20 False
10!=20 True
10>20 False


2. List is an ordered sequence of elements in python. 
Difference between indexing and slicing
list1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
indexing: list1[1]  =2
slicing : list1[2:5]  = [3,4]

Day 4
1. Built-in uctions are the ones which are pre defined in python and ready to use. 
e.g. sorted function 
2. Set is unordered and unindexed collection of elements. It cannot have duplicates.
Set differs from tuple that tuples are immutable while sets are mutable.
tuples can have duplicates while sets cannot have duplicates.
